## Ensembles
- Analyze the data and create a processing pipeline. We are interested if we can predict whether a flight gets delayed or not (arr_delay).  
- Fit a logistic regression, decision tree, and SVM using grid search. Discuss the performance of each model.  
- Fit an ensemble using the three above models. Does this improvement performance?  
- Fit a model using AdaBoost. Does this improve performance?  

#### Note: Performance of AdaBoostClassifier is good compared to all other
